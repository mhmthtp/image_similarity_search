## Making vector search for images with AI

What I used for the project:
- Milvus
- Attu
- Docker
- facenet_pytorch

- run docker for Milvus db
- You can use Attu in "http://localhost:8000/":
    user name:"root"
    password:"Milvus"

- face_detection_images.rar contains project images
- If you change images directory don't forget update your code
